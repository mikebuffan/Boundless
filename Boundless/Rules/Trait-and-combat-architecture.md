Boundless — Trait & Combat Architecture (Draft Lock)
I. Core Combat Philosophy
1. Dice vs AP
Dice represent capacity.
AP represents exertion.
AP limits how much can be executed.
Dice represent how well that execution resolves.
AP is sacred and is not modified by traits, training, equipment, or components.
2. Resolution Purity Rule
Traits never grant automatic successes.
Traits never alter success thresholds.
Traits never bypass dice mechanics.
All resolution is dice-based.
Automatic successes exist only within the core dice system.
II. Natural Equipment Doctrine
Traits that provide natural weapons or armor (Claws, Fangs, Scales, Shell, Exoskeleton, etc.) function as natural equipment profiles.
1. Weapons
Natural weapons are always available.
They do not require AP to ready.
AP is spent to execute attack components.
Natural weapons replace weapon profiles; they do not stack with them.
Example: Claws do not augment sword attacks.
2. Armor
Natural armor is always active.
Natural armor does not stack with worn armor.
A Specialist uses either worn armor profile or natural armor profile.
No automatic stacking unless explicitly designed.
III. Passive vs Active Defense
Passive Defense
Passive defense is always available unless performing an active defense.
Base Passive Defense:
1d10 per 10 Agility
Training Bonuses (Passive Only):
Armor Training: +1d10 per tier (max +5d10 at Master)
Unarmored Training: +1d10 per tier (max +5d10 at Master)
Shield Training does NOT apply to passive defense
Natural Armor:
+1d10 per tier of natural armor
Passive defense:
Rolls against every incoming attack
Costs no AP
Cannot be combined with active defense
Active Defense
Requires AP expenditure.
Passive dice cannot be used during active defense.
Active defense represents tactical burst mitigation.
This creates a choice:
Spend AP offensively and rely on passive defense.
Reserve AP for defensive bursts.
IV. Trait System Architecture
1. Trait Types
Traits fall into two structural categories:
A. Fixed Traits (Single Tier)
Have one assigned tier.
Have a fixed cost.
Do not scale.
Examples: Keen Hearing, Webbed Fingers, Hooves, Putrid.
B. Progressive Traits (Tiered)
Follow Simple → Basic → Intermediate → Advanced → Master.
Must be purchased sequentially.
Cost per tier:
Simple: 3
Basic: 6
Intermediate: 9
Advanced: 12
Master: 15
Total cost to reach Master: 45
Examples:
Wings
Extra Limbs
Extra Heads
Size (if scalable)
Shapeshifter
Incorporeal
2. Sequential Purchase Rule
To purchase a higher tier of a progressive trait, all lower tiers must first be purchased.
Example: Master Wings requires: 3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 15 = 45 total investment.
3. Branching Trait Trees
Progressive traits may branch.
Each node must clearly list:
Tier
Cost
Prerequisites
Exclusions
This prevents dependency spaghetti.
4. Prerequisites & Exclusions
Traits may:
Require other traits (e.g., Advanced Wings require Lightweight).
Exclude other traits (e.g., Exoskeleton excludes Scales).
Belong to anatomical families.
No dynamic cost changes. No conditional refund logic.
5. Trait Permanence Rule
Traits cannot be voluntarily removed.
Traits cannot be downgraded for refund.
Negative traits grant creation points only at creation.
Negative traits cannot be improved away by player choice.
If a trait can be improved, it can be reduced — but never for refund and never voluntarily.
V. Dice Scaling Rules
1. Dice Stack Without Artificial Cap
Dice from:
Stats
Training
Traits
Equipment
Components
Stack freely.
There is no arbitrary dice cap.
The limiter is AP.
2. Traits Add Dice, Not Rules
Traits:
Add dice to specific rolls.
Add new attack types.
Add movement types.
Add defensive profiles.
Traits do not:
Grant automatic success.
Modify AP thresholds.
Modify success numbers.
Override core mechanics.
VI. Offensive & Defensive Symmetry
Both offense and defense scale via:
Stats
Training
Traits
Components
Equipment
No asymmetrical scaling systems.
Balance emerges through:
XP expenditure
Sequential tier cost
AP constraints
Passive vs active defense tension
VII. Tactical Identity
Combat tension emerges from:
AP allocation decisions.
Passive baseline vs active burst defense.
Capacity vs exertion tradeoff.
Specialization vs balance builds.
Boundless is:
Modular
Stackable
Dice-driven
AP-throttled
Open-ended
Structurally contained

General Rules
Traits never grant automatic success.
Traits never modify AP thresholds.
Traits only add dice, replace profiles, or grant defined capabilities.
Only one Dominant Skin may provide combat benefits.
Extra limbs and extra heads do not grant additional actions or AP.
Hunger Dice may be used on any roll and are capped at tier.
