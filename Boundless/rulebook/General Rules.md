General Rules
Boundless operates on a unified resolution system. Whether a Specialist is swinging a blade, shaping fire, negotiating with a noble, or clinging to a cliff face in the rain, the same core mechanics apply. There are no alternate subsystems hidden behind magic, no exception-driven combat engine, and no special-case logic for skills. Every action resolves through the same foundation: dice pools, successes, Action Points, and tier thresholds.
Understanding this chapter means understanding the spine of the entire game.
Dice Pools and Success
All actions in Boundless are resolved using ten-sided dice (d10s). When a Specialist attempts something meaningful — an attack, a spell, a defensive maneuver, a skill test — they gather a number of d10s into a pool and roll them simultaneously.
Each die showing 6 through 10 counts as a success.
Each die showing 1 through 5 counts as a failure.
The total number of successes determines the strength of the outcome.
In many cases, a single success is enough to accomplish a basic task. In more difficult situations, success is relative — measured against opposition, resistance, or a required threshold. What matters most is not merely whether you succeed, but by how much.
Building a Dice Pool
A Specialist’s dice pool is assembled from multiple sources. The most common contributors include:
●Relevant stat dice
●Training tiers
●Component investment
●Traits
●Equipment bonuses
●Situational modifiers
●Luck dice (if chosen)
All dice are rolled together. Successes are counted at the same time. There are no separate rolls for damage, attack accuracy, or effect strength — unless explicitly defined elsewhere. Boundless favors single, meaningful rolls over layered sub-rolls.
Opposed Rolls
When two forces act against one another, both sides roll their respective dice pools. This is called an opposed roll.
Opposed rolls are used in combat, grappling, spell resolution, social interactions, contested skill checks, and any situation where one character’s action directly challenges another.
Both parties roll. The side with more successes prevails.
If the roll results in a tie, the outcome depends on context. In combat, ties produce glancing blows. In other situations, ties may represent partial success, stalemate, or mutual complication. The specific handling of ties is explained in the relevant chapters.
Opposed rolls are the default method of conflict resolution in Boundless.
Action Points (AP)
Action Points represent exertion — the tempo and intensity a Specialist can sustain during their turn.
Every Specialist has at least 1 AP. Additional AP is gained through Speed, at a rate of +1 AP for every 5 points of Speed.
A Specialist with Speed 4 has 1 AP.
A Specialist with Speed 10 has 2 AP.
A Specialist with Speed 15 has 3 AP.
AP refreshes at the start of the Specialist’s turn.
Action Points are not stamina in a long-term sense; they represent immediate capacity within a combat round or structured exchange. Outside structured time, AP may be used narratively as pacing guidance but does not require strict tracking.
Tier Thresholds
Every action in Boundless is governed by tier limits. These tiers cap how much AP may be invested in a single action.
The tier ladder is as follows:
Simple — up to 3 AP
Basic — up to 6 AP
Intermediate — up to 9 AP
Advanced — up to 12 AP
Master — up to 15 AP
When constructing an action, you may not exceed the AP ceiling of the highest-tier component involved. If the most advanced component used is Basic, the entire action cannot exceed 6 AP. If an Advanced component is included, you may invest up to 12 AP in total.
These thresholds apply universally: martial maneuvers, spells, defensive bursts, skill uses, and special abilities all follow the same structure.
Damage Resolution
In combat, damage is determined by the difference in successes between attacker and defender.
If the attacker achieves more successes, subtract the defender’s successes from the attacker’s total. The difference becomes the number of damage dice rolled (d10s).
If the roll is tied, the blow is glancing. A glancing blow deals 1d10 damage.
Damage resolution always follows this success-difference model unless explicitly modified by a component or condition.
Luck
Luck
Luck represents the daily swing of fortune. It is not a permanent stat and it is not predictable from day to day.
At the start of each day, a Specialist rolls 1d10 to determine their Luck Point pool for that day. The result is the number of Luck Points available.
Luck Points may be spent to influence rolls. When you spend a Luck Point, you add one special Luck die (a d10) to your roll. Luck must be declared before the roll is made.
Luck dice do not behave like normal dice. Instead:
If the Luck die rolls 6–10, it adds +1 success.
If the Luck die rolls 1–5, it subtracts –1 success.
Luck can help you—sometimes dramatically—but it can also betray you at the worst moment. Luck is permitted on initiative rolls, but you may not apply more than one Luck die to initiative.
Critical Success
A critical success requires two conditions:
The roll must have more successes than failures.
The roll must include a number of 10s equal to the tier used.
The required number of 10s is:
Simple — 1
Basic — 2
Intermediate — 3
Advanced — 4
Master — 5
If both conditions are met, the action is a critical success.
In combat, critical successes double damage dice. In defense, they may destabilize an attacker’s next strike. In skills and magic, they produce amplified or exceptional outcomes as described in their respective chapters.
Critical Failure
A critical failure mirrors critical success.
To critically fail:
The roll must have more failures than successes.
The roll must include a number of 1s equal to the tier used.
The required number of 1s follows the same tier ladder as critical successes.
Critical failures represent severe missteps — counterattacks, lost footing, magical backlash, or narrative consequences appropriate to the action.
Conditions
Conditions are standardized mechanical states applied through martial techniques, spells, traits, environmental hazards, or crafting mishaps.
Conditions follow consistent rules across the system. They do not alter AP thresholds unless explicitly described, and they stack only when specified.
The full list of conditions and their effects are detailed in the Conditions chapter.
